    "\n",
    "- With the growing global demand for subsurface resources such as critical minerals, rare earth elements, geothermal energy, and groundwater, the **sustainable management of surface and subsurface systems** IS a critical scientific and societal priority. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A geochemical anomaly, for Soil geochemistry provides a direct window into surface and subsurface processes, mineralization, and environmental conditions, making it a key tool for **mapping contamination, mineral prospectivity, field exploration geology and environmental protection**  (Carranza,2009).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mineral deposits produce **distinctive soil geochemical signatures**, which can extend several kilometers due to weathering, erosion, and sediment transport. These geochemical footprints can reach **up to 6 km**, leading to naturally elevated metal concentrations even in areas without direct mining activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In mineralized terrains like Kalumbila, soil geochemistry reflects a **complex mixture of natural geological enrichment and potential anthropogenic inputs**, making the assessment of pollution allegations challenging.  \n",
    "\n",

    "  - Long-term tropical weathering  \n",
    "\n",
